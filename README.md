# Capstone Project - Simple Static Website
  This project was completed as part of The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp by Dr. Angela on Udemy.

## Project Overview
  This capstone project is a static website created entirely with HTML. The project serves as a demonstration of fundamental HTML skills, including semantic structure, text formatting, multimedia integration, and   link handling. The goal was to design a simple, user-friendly web page that effectively showcases core HTML knowledge without the use of CSS, JavaScript, or any backend technologies.

## Project Features
  Responsive Structure: The page is organized with a clear HTML structure, leveraging semantic tags such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>, <section>, and <article>.
  Content Variety: The project includes various types of content, such as headings, paragraphs, lists (both ordered and unordered), and tables.
  Multimedia Integration: Images, audio, and videos are embedded using HTML tags to enrich the content and user experience.
  Internal and External Links: The site features links that navigate within the same page (internal) and links to external resources (external).
  Accessibility: Attention was given to creating an accessible experience by adding alt attributes to images and using clear, descriptive links.
## Project Sections
  The following sections are included in the website:

    ### Home Section: A welcome message introducing the project, with navigation links to other sections of the site.
    ### About Section: A brief description of the project goals and an outline of the HTML features used.
    ### Portfolio Section: An image gallery showcasing example content or placeholder images.
    ### Contact Section: A simple contact form built entirely with HTML forms, including input fields and buttons.
    ### Footer: Information about the course and credit to Dr. Angela for her guidance.
    ### Technologies Used HTML5: The entire project is developed using HTML5, showcasing the structure and layout capabilities of HTML without additional styles or scripting.
